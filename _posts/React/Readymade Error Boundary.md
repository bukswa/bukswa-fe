Hey guys,

I came across this readymade error boundary component for react which is available ready to use.

Now you don't to create a separate class component in your react application with 
`getDerivedStateFromError()` or `componentDidCatch()` methods.

Here is the link to the repository - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary"> Error Boundary Package Link</a>
